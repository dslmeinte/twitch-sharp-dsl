# README

This repository holds the implementation of a tiny projectional DSL to do some data modeling _รก la_ Alec Sharp with.
It's used in my Twitch session on October 17th 2020, which is about my book [_Domain-Specific Languages made easy_](https://shortener.manning.com/r2Rx) for Manning Publications.
